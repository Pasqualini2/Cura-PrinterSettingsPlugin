# Printer Settings Plugin

This plugin adds many "machine settings" that are normally not accessible to the sidebar in a new category named "Printer Settings". Only those settings that can be changed "on the fly" are included.

Changes made in the sidebar override values set in the machine definition and end up in quality profiles. It is not recommended to use this plugin.
